# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Titanic-Passengers-Data
The aim of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis on the Titanic passengers' data, which is publicly available on the Kaggle website. The dataset contains information about each passenger, including their unique identifier, class of travel, name, gender, age, number of siblings or life partner, number of children, fare, and boarding location. The most crucial variable in this dataset is whether the person survived or not during the Titanic immersion.

The purpose of this analysis is to identify patterns in the data that could potentially explain why some passengers survived the event while others did not. This project is limited to the training dataset, which contains the most significant amount of data and includes the target variable, i.e., survivors.

Python libraries such as NumPy and pandas are used for data exploration, while Seaborn and Matplotlib are used for visualizations. The scope of this project is to gain insights into the dataset and identify relationships between variables that could be used for future predictions.
